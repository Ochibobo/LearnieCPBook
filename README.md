### A Book on JuliaCP

This book is meant to provide context on [JuliaCP](https://github.com/Ochibobo/JuliaCP). It's the documentation on my journey implementing [MiniCP](http://minicp.org/) in __Julia__. I will strive to provide an explanation on everything I've come across accompanied by examples and appropriate diagrams. 

The book has been written using [quarto](https://quarto.org/).
